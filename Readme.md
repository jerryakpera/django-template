# Django Project Quickstart Template

This template provides a streamlined setup for quickly starting Django projects with best practices for virtual environments, dependency management, and pre-commit hooks.

## Setup

1. **Create a virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/Scripts/activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   - Install development dependencies:
     ```sh
     pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
     ```
   - Install production dependencies:
     ```sh
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
3. **Install precommit**:
   - Install precommit to handle checks before commit
     ```sh
     pre-commit.ext install
     ```

## Dependency Management

We use [pip-tools](https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/) to handle dependencies efficiently:

1. Add your production dependencies to `requirements.in`:

   - Example: `Django==5.1.1`

2. Compile the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip-compile requirements.in
   ```

3. Install the compiled dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Development dependencies (such as `pip-tools`, linters, and formatters) are listed in `requirements-dev.txt`.

## Django Project Setup

1. **Create the Django project**:

   ```bash
   django-admin startproject core .
   ```

2. **Restructure the project**:
   - Move all files from the `core` directory into a new `config` directory.
   - Create a `settings` folder within the `config` directory and move `settings.py` into it.
   - Rename `settings.py` to `base.py` and adjust the import paths in the following files:
     - `manage.py`
     - `wsgi.py`
     - `asgi.py`
     - `base.py`

## Pre-commit Hooks

We use [pre-commit](https://pypi.org/project/pre-commit/) to ensure code quality before commits. To set this up:

1. Install pre-commit:

   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit==3.8.0
   ```

2. Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file with hooks such as:

   - Trailing whitespace removal
   - End-of-file fixer
   - Large file check
   - Python code formatting and linting (isort, Black, Flake8)
   - Security analysis with Bandit
   - Django project checks

3. Run the checks manually:

   ```bash
   pre-commit run -a
   ```

4. Add pre-commit configuration to the `pyproject.toml` file.

5. Install the pre-commit hook to run automatically before every commit:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Linting and Code Formatting

- **Flake8**: Lints Python code for style and logic errors.
- **Black**: Formats Python code according to PEP8.
- **isort**: Sorts Python imports.

Add the following to your `setup.cfg` to configure these tools:

```cfg
[flake8]
max-line-length = 99
exclude = **/migrations/*,venv
extend-ignore = E203, W503, F403, F401

[isort]
profile = black
```

## Summary of Pre-commit Checks

Run pre-commit checks using:

```bash
pre-commit run -a
```

This will check for:

1. **Trailing whitespace**: Removes unnecessary spaces.
2. **End-of-file fixer**: Ensures all files end with a newline.
3. **Check large files**: Warns if large files are added.
4. **isort**: Ensures imports are properly sorted.
5. **Black**: Automatically formats Python code to PEP8 standards.
6. **Flake8**: Lints the Python code for errors.
7. **Bandit**: Checks for common security issues.
8. **Django check**: Validates Django project configurations with `python manage.py check`.
